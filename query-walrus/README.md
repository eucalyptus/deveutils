Queries Walrus DB entities directly to get info not available from the API endpoint. Resolves files on the filesystem to buckets and objects.

Requirements to run:
* Eucalyptus binaries installed
* EucaAdmin tools must be installed (euca-modify-property must work)
* Credentials: see next
* $EUCALYPTUS must be set to the root directory of the eucalyptus installation on the local host. For a package install, that is usually '/'. For a
source install it is whatever --with-prefix was set to during ./configure time of the source build.

* The Eucalyptus Walrus component must be running on the local host.
* You must have admin credentials for the Eucalyptus install and have EC2_URL set to the local host. The easiest way to accomplish this is to source the eucarc file
on the local host (SC) after modifying the EC2_URL line to refer to the current local IP instead of the CLC.

##Usage

usage: query-walrus <sub-command> <options>

###Sub-commands:
* lookup-object-from-file <file path from $EUCALYPTUS/var/lib/eucalyptus/bukkits> : given the bucket/filename it returns the object key and bucket as well as object info for the file
* lookup-file-from-object <bucket/object key> : given the bucket/object-key it displays where that object is stored on the filesystem relative to $EUCALYPTUS/var/lib/eucalyptus/bukkits
* lookup-snapshot-from-file <bucket/snapshot_file_path> : returns the snapshotId and info that correspond to the file on the filesystem 
* lookup-file-from-snapshot <snap-Id> : returns the bucket and file that represent the given snapshot on Walrus
* list-bucket <bucket> : lists all objects in the bucket including object keys and the files that correspond to those keys
* list-cached-images : lists all images currently in the Walrus image cache as well as the files that correspond to the constructed and cached images

For all sub-commands that take a file as input, use the path relative to the 'bukkits' directory.

For all sub-commands that take an object key, include the bucket/object-key path
